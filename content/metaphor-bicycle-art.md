i love riding my bicycle

you don't need to know the mechanics in order to enjoy riding it

you can take it easy, you can sweat

the bicycle doesn't have a backdoor where someone could spy on me, or brick it, or is collecting data about my whereabouts

i wish all computational tools gave us the same freedom and experience as bikes do
